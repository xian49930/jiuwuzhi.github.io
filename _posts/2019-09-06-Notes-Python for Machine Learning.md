| **Supervised Learning**                                     | **Unsupervised Learning**                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classification**:<br/> Classifies labeled data                 | **Clustering**:<br/> Finds patterns and groupings from unlabeled data |
| **Regression**:<br/> Predicts trends using previous labeled data |                                                              |
| Has more evaluation methods                             | Has fewer evaluation methods than supervised learning        |
| Controlled environment                                  | Less controlled environment                                  |

- Unsupervised Learning
	- *The model works on its own to discover information.*
	- Unlabelled data.
	- Techniques include:
		- Dimension reduction
		- Density estimation
		- Market basket analysis
		- **Clustering**  *(one of most popular)*
	- ***Clustering***: grouping of data points or objects that are somehow **similar** by:
		- Discovering structure
		- Summarization
		- Anomaly detection


- Supervised Learning
	- *We "teach the model", then with that knowledge, it can predict unknown or future instances.*
	- Labelled data. 
	- ***Classification***: the process of predicting discrete class lebels or categories.
	- ***Regression***: the process of predicting continuous values.

- Python libraries for machine learning (***upper level marked in bold***)
	- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
	- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
	- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
	- [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
	- [**scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
