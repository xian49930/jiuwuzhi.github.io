# Major Aspects in the Selection of Pumps and Motors

The selection of pumps is determined by a number of factors which include:

- Cost
- Pressure ripple and noise
- Suction performance
- Contaminant sensitivity
- Speed
- Weight
- Fixed or variable displacement
- Maximum pressure and flow, or power
- Fluid type
