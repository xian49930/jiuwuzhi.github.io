# Notes 

This posts records all my notes for the online course - Python for Data Science and AI - on Coursera.com.

*New notes will be added on the top of the older ones.*


## Week 2


## Week 1

- **4 Collection Data Types** in Python:
	- **List** is a collection which is ***ordered*** and ***changeable***. ...
	- **Tuple** is a collection which is ***ordered*** and ***unchangeable***. ...
	- **Set** is a collection which is ***unordered*** and ***unindexed***. ...
	- **Dictionary** is a collection which is ***unordered, changeable and indexed***.

- Sets
	- No duplicates.
	- {element 1, element 2, element 3, ...}
	- Set_1.add('new_element')
	- Set_1.remove('old_element')
	- 'Set_1 & Set_2' outputs the overlay of these two sets.

- Dictionaries
	- Keys & Values
	- {"key_1":value_1, "key_2":value_2, ...}

- Lists
	- [element 1, element 2, element 3...]
	 - Aliasing
	 	- B = A
	 	- Refer to the same list. B & A changes at the same time
	 	- Use 'Clone' to refer to the different lists.
	 - Clone
	 	- B = A[:]
	 	- Refer to the different lists.

- Tuples
	- Tuples: a finite ordered list of elements. (element 1, element 2, element 3...)
	- Tuples are *immutable*.
	- Nesting

- Math Operation
	- **Operands** and Operators.
